# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
A collection of my implementations and insights on various machine learning algorithms, including both theory and code examples.


## Algorithms Covered

- Supervised Learning
  - Linear Regression
 

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations and code examples.
- 'pdf' - Notion/ Handwritten notes

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-algorithms-learnings.git
2. Install dependencies:
    ```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  Or
    Use Anaconda (jupiter notebook) > run .ipynb files
