## Algorithms Covered

- Supervised Learning
  1. Linear Regression
  2. Multiple Linar Regression
 

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations and code examples.
- 'pdf' - Handwritten notes
- Notion - Typed notes 'https://www.notion.so/Machine-Learning-1c4ea788dcaa80f5a1a2cbb0f91f24db?pvs=4'

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-algorithms-learnings.git
2. Install dependencies:
    ```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  Or
